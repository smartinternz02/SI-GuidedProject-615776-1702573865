    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <div class="section">
        
        <p>Diabetes is a chronic medical condition that affects how your body processes glucose, a form of sugar. There are several types of diabetes, with the most common being Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes. It's important to understand the causes, symptoms, risk factors, prevention, and treatment options for diabetes.</p>
        <p>Diabetes is a global health concern, and its prevalence is on the rise. It can lead to serious complications if not managed effectively. Education and awareness are crucial for prevention and early intervention.</p>
    </div><br>

    <h2>Causes of Diabetes</h2>
    <div class="section">
        
        <p>Diabetes can develop when the body cannot effectively use insulin or when the pancreas does not produce enough insulin. Causes may include genetic factors, an autoimmune response, or lifestyle choices like poor diet and lack of physical activity.</p>
        <p>Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune condition where the immune system mistakenly attacks and destroys insulin-producing cells in the pancreas. Type 2 diabetes often results from a combination of genetic predisposition and lifestyle factors.</p>
    </div><br>

    <h2>Symptoms of Diabetes</h2>
    <div class="section">
        
        <p>The symptoms of diabetes can vary depending on the type and severity but often include increased thirst, frequent urination, unexplained weight loss, fatigue, blurred vision, and slow wound healing.</p>
        <p>Prolonged high blood sugar levels can lead to more serious symptoms and complications, such as nerve damage, kidney problems, and cardiovascular issues. Early diagnosis and management are essential to prevent these complications.</p>
    </div><br>

    <h2>Risk Factors</h2>
    <div class="section">
        
        <p>Risk factors for developing diabetes include family history, obesity, a sedentary lifestyle, poor diet, age, and certain medical conditions. Understanding these risk factors can help in prevention and early detection.</p>
        <p>Family history of diabetes can increase your risk, as can age, with the risk increasing as you get older. Maintaining a healthy weight, staying physically active, and making nutritious food choices can significantly reduce your risk of developing diabetes.</p>
    </div><br>

    <h2>Prevention</h2>
    <div class="section">
        
        <p>Preventing diabetes involves adopting a healthy lifestyle. This includes maintaining a balanced diet, engaging in regular physical activity, managing stress, and avoiding smoking and excessive alcohol consumption.</p>
        <p>Eating a diet rich in whole grains, lean proteins, fruits, and vegetables while limiting sugary and high-fat foods can help regulate blood sugar levels and support overall health. Regular exercise improves insulin sensitivity and helps with weight management.</p>
    </div><br>

    <h2>Treatment</h2>
    <div class="section">
        
        <p>Treatment for diabetes varies depending on the type and severity. It may involve lifestyle changes, oral medications, insulin therapy, and close monitoring of blood sugar levels. It's essential to work closely with a healthcare provider to manage diabetes effectively.</p>
        <p>People with diabetes need to monitor their blood sugar levels regularly and adjust their treatment plan as needed. Lifestyle modifications are a cornerstone of diabetes management, and healthcare providers can provide guidance on medication when necessary.</p>
